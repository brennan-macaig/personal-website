      <description>As the holiday season begins with the end of black friday (and the winding down of my semester) - a new but familiar challenge approaches. I am of course talking about Advent of Code - the crazy series of events put together by Eric Wastl.
Every year, I do (at least part of) the Advent of Code (or AoC) challenges. And every year, I progress further in the set of challenges than I did the year before.</description>

      <description>My name is Brennan, and welcome to my new blog.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to be more active in writing a blog - this will be mostly useless musings, with maybe the occasional interesting story.
A lot of what I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing will be something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;today I learned&amp;rdquo; - as I am very much still a student (oh hey, thanks Blake for this fantastic idea).
Recently, a friend of mine Nate started a new blog, which really inspired me to get on the blog writing train.</description>
