I'm a Site Reliability Engineering Intern at [Mutualink](https://mutualink.net), 
a full time CS student at [UMass Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/News/stories/2020/Students-connect-on-HawkCraft.aspx), and a [FIRST robotics mentor](https://sites.google.com/nhsau57.org/salemrobotics), based out of Lowell MA.

As a site reliability engineer, I focus on building secure, scalable, maintainable infrastructure. Previously, I worked as a full stack web developer, writing performance-oriented business-to-business SaaS apps.

In my free time, I maintain a [blog](/posts/), as well as develop personal IoT projects around the house. Sometimes, I pretend that I can take pictures of things, which I post on my Instagram. I also love being outdoors, and spend a lot of my weekends camping, fishing, or exploring cities.
