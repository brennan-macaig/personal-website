As the holiday season begins with the end of black friday (and the winding down of my semester) - a new but familiar challenge 
approaches. I am of course talking about Advent of Code - the crazy series of events put together by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).

Every year, I do (at least part of) the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (or AoC) challenges. And every year, I progress further
in the set of challenges than I did the year before. I keep meaning to go back and complete the days I miss - and I miss a lot of days! 
- but I just never get around to it I suppose. I've at least participated in every single AoC since 2015 - with my most stars collected (25, or 50%) last year in 2019. 

For those who don't understand AoC, the premise is quite simple - you need to code your way into saving christmas, and to do so you 
collect 50 stars. For the first 25 days of December - you know, _advent_ - a puzzle is released at 12:00 AM EST. Each puzzle has two 
parts - the first typically easier, and the second typically requires a partial rewrite (depending on how rushed you wrote your first 
solution).

So, this year, I'll be doing AoC once again. I _think_ I'll be writing in Python this year, even though I've really been enjoying Go.
So, the question now is "why" -

### Why do Advent of Code?

1. I want to improve my programmatic puzzle-solving, which is typically a useful tool for a software engineer to poses.
2. I think it's fun, and I'm really bored staying at home all day (thanks, 'rona).

### Why Python? Why not Go?

While I do love Go and complete most of my professional work in Go, Go is in my opinion not the right fit for AoC. Python is a language
much better suited to challenges like the ones that AoC poses. For example, below is a table explaining the pros-and-cons of both given 
the context of AoC:

| Python | Go |
|:-------:|:-:|
|Very fast to type | Error handling makes tasks take more time to write |
|Very easy string manipulation in the standard library | Much more "do-it-with-regex", and again, all that error handling |
|Matplotlib *exists* in python |Matplotlib *does not exist* in Go |

See, usually when I'm writing software in Go, it's software I never want to blow up, no matter what I feed it. AoC however, I don't
much care if my python script explodes - I'm running it all inside a bunch of custom tooling anyways. In fact - I _want_ my code to explode, as fast as humanly possible.

### How do you prepare for Advent of Code

1. Prep a bunch of files and custom tools that I'll use in AoC.
2. Make a git repo
3. Wait eagerly

No, seriously. That's about it. I want the puzzles to ramp up as I do them - days getting harder, so day 1 will put me in a puzzle mode,
and day 2 will set me on the path to AoC greatness (or, well, I would like it if it did).

### Leaderboard?

Nah. I think staying up to midnight (or as late as 1:00am) - when I work at 8am - is hard. So I won't be doing that. Instead, I'll
probably work on the challenges in the mornings, or in the evenings after work.

### OK, so what about it?

Well, I'll be documenting my work on these puzzles here on the blog every day (doing a write-up of my solution). It won't be pretty
code, but it should certainly work for what I need it to.

That's all folks! If you want to play along, feel free! DM me on twitter and let me know - I'm looking forward to it!

Until December 1st!
