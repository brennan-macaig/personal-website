My name is Brennan, and welcome to my new blog.

I'm trying to be more active in writing a blog - this will be mostly useless musings, with maybe the occasional interesting story.

A lot of what I'll be writing will be something along the lines of "today I learned" - as I am very much still a student (oh hey, thanks [Blake](https://github.com/TechplexEngineer/til) for this fantastic idea).

Recently, a friend of mine [Nate started a new blog](https://www.natecordova.com/blog), which really inspired me to get on the blog writing train.

Additionally, [a coworker Steve](https://www.0x2d13.net/) has been pretty active in his blog, which has also really pushed me to actually get started.
Steve actually recommended the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) tool that I use to build my blog. If you're not familiar, Hugo is a pretty neat tool for static website creation.
It's written in Go too, which is great, because recently I've really been loving Go and the community (again, thanks Steve!).

I'm looking forward to sharing more with all of you!
